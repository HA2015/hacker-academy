<h2 class="red-header">Hacker Academy</h2>

<p>
  Hacker Academy (HA) is a student-run club at the University of Toronto. We strive to provide an environment in which students can develop and engage their interests in technological developments, programming, and the role of technology, particularly software, in our lives and society at large. We live by the hacker culture, which is all about promoting and practicing cleverness and creativity, having an inquisitive attitude, sharing knowledge, and hands-on learning. 
</p>

<p class="quotation">
  “A hacker is someone who enjoys creatively overcoming intellectual challenges in technology.”
</p>

<p class="quotation">
  “To hackers, hacking is a hobby, a form of exploration – but it also entails some form of excellence, for example exploring the limits of what is possible – thereby doing something exciting and meaningful.”

  Programming Competitions
